# Vehicle Controller
Vehicle Controller lets you adjust the spawn rate of vehicle types. If you want your city to have many pickup cars and just a few SUVs and Motorcycles, this mod is for you!
This mod also offers more realistic values for vehicle behaviour. In the base game almost all vehicles have the same acceleration and top speed, this mods adds more realism to the game.

## Features
- Adjustable Percentage of Vanilla spawn rate for Motorbike, Scooters, SUVs, Pickups, Vans and more
- Adjusted Max Speeds, Acceleration and Braking Power for all Vanilla Vehicles
- Reduced Acceleration and Braking Power for Trains for more realistic behaviour

## Planned Features
- Adjustable settings for Car and Train Behaviour (acceleration, braking, max speed)
- Options for service buildings to select vehicles that can be spawned by that building
