## [Vehicle Controller](https://mods.paradoxplaza.com/mods/104781/Windows) 

### Upcoming Features

## Service Vehicle Selection
- Select which service building can spawn which vehicles
- Allows to select multiple prefabs per individual building, that will always be used
- Copy and Paste your values to other buildings of the same name, all other buildings in the district, or even the whole map
- Suggestions welcome

## Vehicle Probability Packs
- Tune vehicle probabilities using packs or the integrated sliders to your liking
- Your selection will be saved in your savegame
- Example: You are tired of seeing Muscle Cars and Pickup Trucks in your small french city? Reduce probability for Muscle Cars and Pickup Trucks, more other vehicles will spawn!
- Example: You are building a desert city in the US? Heavily increase the probability of Pickup Trucks, SUVs, decrease Hatchbacks!

## Vehicle Property Packs
- In the default game, most personal cars have the same Acceleration, Top Speed and Braking. Vehicle Property Packs are the way to change this
- Multiple preset packs:
- Vanilla Rebalance (Every vehicle has optimized values, electric cars have high acceleration, lower top speed, vans and trucks are slow, etc.)
- True Realism (like Vanilla Rebalance, but all speeds are halved, because the game uses double speed for vehicles)
- Double Time (like Vanilla Rebalance, but all speeds are doubled. Suitable for big maps!)
