# [Vehicle Controller](https://mods.paradoxplaza.com/mods/104781/Windows)

Vehicle Controller gives you full control over how service and personal vehicles appear and behave in your city. Mix and match your favorite prefabs, tailor spawn rates, and fine-tune driving properties without leaving the game.
## Key Features

### Service Vehicle Selection
- Choose exactly which prefabs each service building is allowed to spawn
- Build per-building lineups and copy/paste them across identical buildings, entire districts, or the whole map for quick setup
- Your selections are saved with the city, ensuring consistent vehicle appearances every time you load

### Vehicle Probability Packs
- Load curated probability packs or create your own balance by adjusting sliders for every personal vehicle class
- Probability choices are persisted per save to ensure a consistent look and feel
- Example: You are tired of seeing Muscle Cars and Pickup Trucks in your small French city? Reduce probability for Muscle Cars and Pickup Trucks, more other vehicles will spawn!
- Example: You are building a desert city in the US? Heavily increase the probability of Pickup Trucks, SUVs, decrease Hatchbacks!


### Vehicle Property Packs
In the default game, most personal cars have the same Acceleration, Top Speed and Braking. Vehicle Property Packs are the way to change this
- Swap between preset packs that tweak max speed, acceleration, and braking for personal cars and trains
- Choose from options like *Improved*
- Property choices are persisted per save to ensure a consistent look and feel

## Speed Limits
- Choose Speed Limit Override for Realistic (0.5x), Vanilla (1x), Double (2x) or Super Speed (10x)
- Works for Roads, Train Tracks, Subway Tracks, Tram Tracks and Waterways

### Quality-of-Life Settings
- Integrated settings tab with logging controls, reset buttons, and quick actions to apply probability or property changes
- Clipboard support for exporting and sharing service vehicle lineups with other saves or players

## Compatibility & Notes
- Works with existing saves; just load the save and configure your preferred packs
- The mod stores vanilla probability and property data so you can revert at any time
